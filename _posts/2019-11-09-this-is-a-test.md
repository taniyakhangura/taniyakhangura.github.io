  I choose to make a blog because I love learning about fashion, listening and
  analyzing the news, and sharing some personal work. Also, using a limited
  colour palette (pastels) and simple design was important to me to show a sleek
  look.

As a side project, and a hobby, I decided to start a blog to document my thoughts on fashion trends, news, and some poems I wrote. Some people create YouTube videos, some people create online zines, and some people write blogs about their interests and passions.

I did not use a pre-made template as I did not feel they were suited to my liking at the time. I wanted the look to be clear, and clean with an appropriate amount of negative space.
