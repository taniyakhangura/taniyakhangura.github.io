* My father started a cushion company
* I offered to help him design and operate the website from scratch on Wix (without a pre-made template)
* Doing this, I gained experience with building the page layouts and skin (design) of a digital project.
* Negative space was important for me to create
* Having a call to action was important to include on the first page
