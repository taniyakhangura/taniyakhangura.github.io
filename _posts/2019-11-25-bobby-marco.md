In the summer of 2018 and into my first year of university, I was offered to help design the website of my father's new company. In order to complete the project, I used my own previous knowledge, and new information I learned from being in my Design Thinking class in first semester.

I created the website on a website builder from scratch, and because I had no pre-set template, it let me explore and use my imagination to build the page layouts and skin (design) of a digital project.

For me, considering and applying the right amount of negative space was important as it focuses the eye to the other focal points on the page. Also, on the landing page, including a call to action was imperative so that people who visit the website know exactly where to buy the cushions.
