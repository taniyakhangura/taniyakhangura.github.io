  The inspiration for my project came from my own need and others as well. I
  constantly heard girls my age and older complain that whenever they ordered
  clothing online from certain stores, it did not fit right. I would also hear
  that their size differs from site to site and it was challenging and
  frustrating to buy clothes this way.


  Therefore, I felt like there must be a better way to tackle this issue. I then
  created a website application where users enter their own measurements in, and
  using the information entered, it renders a 3D model with the selected
  clothing item where one can see it it will fit them to their liking.

As a fan of fashion, I created a web application that helps people to choose the correct size for any type of clothing.

For my UX strategy class, I created a report in which I had to conduct user research by researching companies that create similar applications, interviewing potential users, and conducting contextual inquiries.

I also created user stories, personas, costumer experience maps, low and medium-fidelity prototypes that highlighted my progress from one step to the next.
