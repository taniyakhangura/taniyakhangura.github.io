  While completing this assignment, I felt stuck at certain points, however,
  with the help of online tools, and exploring the application, I was able to
  successfully complete it. I choose to keep my design simple by adding a few
  colours and mainly detailing the shoes so it does not seem too busy.

In my Graphic Design class, we learn how to use and navigate various Adobe applications. Specifically, we learned how to use Adobe InDesign which lead to the making of this project.

The goal of this project was to replicate a Funko Pop model of myself.
